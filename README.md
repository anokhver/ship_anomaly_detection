### Development environment
- The application is developed in a docker container in order to ensure compatibility between team members as well as make the installation of the application easier.
- For the machine learning part we're using python and its scikit-learn library, as well as pandas and numpy for data analysis and editing.
- The GUI visualisation will be done as a web application with a python backend using django framework, and Vue.js frontend and basic tools for development and build (curl, git etc.). For the full list of installed packages/libraries one can check reqirements.txt, frontend/package.json and the Dockerfile.
- Additional tools, that team members use for specific tasks are not included in this summary, but if a deliverable will be made using those tools, information about it will be included with it.

### Git repository structure:
- The **main** branch Contains all deliverables and is the final state of the project at the end of a sprint.
- Other branches are created at will by team members, and are used only for testing, if necessary.
- **data-cleaning** branch, as the name suggests, contains the pipeline for data cleaning (results are stored in the main branch)
