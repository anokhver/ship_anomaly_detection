    "### Clustering Basic concept\n",
    "Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that involves grouping a set of data points into clusters. \\\n",
    "For this we do not need labels, as it finds the patterns byits own. \\\n",
    "Some algorithms require to specify the number of clusters, while others do not.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "For vessel trajectory analysis, clustering can help identify:\n",
    "    - Common/normal route patterns\n",
    "    - Anomalous trajectories that deviate from normal patterns\n",
    "    - Different route types used by vessels\n",
    "\n",
    "### What type of clustering you can try\n",
    "1. Just put this articles in NotebookLM and ask what clustering algorithm is used there\n",
    "    And you can find something on [medium](https://medium.com/)\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Then put them in to ChatGPT or Claude or something ask what is not too over complex for the task and like send what attributes we have ext\n",
    "3. Don't forget anomalies are rare choose the algorithm that is more suitable for that\n",
